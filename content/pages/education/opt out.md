### Opt Out of Sharing VA Education Benefits Information

The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act (also called the “Forever GI Bill”) requires us to share certain information about your education eligibility and benefits with schools, unless you ask us not to.  

### How do I tell VA I don’t want my information shared?  

You’ll need to fill out a short form to tell us you want to opt out of sharing this information. You can get started right now:

<a class="usa-button-primary va-button-primary" href="/education/opt out/form-0993/">Opt Out</a>
  
### Will opting out affect my education benefits?

No. Your education benefits will stay the same if you decide to opt out. You won’t lose any benefits.

### What kind of information does VA share with schools?

We share information about your eligibility and benefits, including:
- Your eligibility date 
- The amount of money you’re receiving for tuition and school fees
- The amount of money you get and the time you have left to use your benefits
- If you’re getting money through the Yellow Ribbon Program.  
[Learn about the Yellow Ribbon program](/education/gi-bill/yellow-ribbon/).
- Residence hours 
- Distance hours
- Benefit percentage (amount of education benefits based on active-duty service time)

### Why does VA share this information?

It makes it easy for schools to access information about your education benefits without you gathering benefit information or filling out forms. Schools get all the information they need. 

### What’s the Colmery Act? 
The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act, also called the “Forever GI Bill,” was signed into law August 2017 and expands education benefits for Veterans, Servicemembers, and their family members.
